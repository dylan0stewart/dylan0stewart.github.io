My first data science project!

I chose to do my data project on Michelin-rated restaurants in the US. 

The Michelin guide is essentially a large set of reviews for the best of the best restaurants around the world, but I focused on the US only for the project. In the US, they only judge restaurants that are in New York city, northern California, LA area, Chicago, and Washington dc. 

 I had two main questions for the data, which were: 

What type of cuisine was the most common?  

And  

Did the type of cuisine have an impact on how many stars a restaurant would earn?
